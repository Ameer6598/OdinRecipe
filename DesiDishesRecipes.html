<li>cup yogurt plain, 2% fat</li>
<li>2 onions small, cut into quarters</li>
<li>¼ cup cashew nuts plain, unsalted</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
<li>2 inch ginger fresh, peeled</li>
<li>3 tsp cumin powder</li>
<li>5 cardamom green, seeds only</li>

<ul>
<b>Instructions</b>

<li>In a large pan, add the chicken and saute for a couple of minutes on medium-high heat.</li><br>
<li>Reduce the heat to low and pour the korma sauce over the chicken. Stir, cover to tightly seal and cook for 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through - stirring occasionally so that the chicken doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Add more water if needed but not too much.</li><br>
<li>Add chopped cilantro, and garam masala and then serve with rice, quinoa, roti, paratha or naan. Toasted cashews on tip are optional!</li><br>
</ul>

    <b>Notes</b>
<li>Slice chicken breast into small similar-sized pieces so they cook evenly.</li>
<li>Add more garam masala for an added flavour boost.</li>
<li>Simmer on low to medium heat, stirring frequently to make sure the korma sauce does not dry out too much and stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
<li>To create a creamy sauce, blend the ingredients thoroughly.</li>
<li>Store-bought garlic and ginger pastes often contain preservatives that make the dish less flavorful. Using fresh ingredients such as fresh garlic, ginger, and cilantro will produce a more authentic taste.</li>
